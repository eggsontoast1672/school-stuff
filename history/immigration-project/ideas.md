# Story Ideas And Notes

## Basic Outline

Wu Qiang is just a regular dude from Shenzhen, China. He has a degree in
computer science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Manufacturing and
supply chain issues caused by COVID-19 have made everyday life hard, and the
best option seems to be to immigrate the United States.

After he moves, he gets a job working the help desk at a semi-large tech
company, but fails to move forward because his accent is hard to interpret over
the phone, and customers give him bad reviews. Under increasing pressure and an
approaching wave of layoffs, Wu's stress levels are very high.

In the end, it turns out the office was still on an old carrier plan, and after
a simple upgrade, everything is fine. It is later revealed that so far, Wu's
ratio between calls taken and hours worked was one of the highest in company
history.

And they all lived happily ever after.

## Some Things To Keep in Mind

Push and pull factors. Maybe something in the person's home country is making
it a bad place to live, or there's something about the United States that makes
it more appealing.

Oftentimes, getting to the U.S. isn't the hard part. It's becoming a citizen
once you're there. Things could be going fine for a while, but then the
government runs up on your ass for some reason or another.
